% Generating phase-locked spike sequences 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input 
%   M: number of input fibers 
%   N: time steps 
%   F: frequency [Hz]
%   R: vector strength (0<=R<=0.96 for a reliable calculation)
%   L: mean rate [spikes/sec] 
%   P: initial phase [rad]
%   DT: time step size [ms] 
% Output
%   A: spike vector (M*N matrix)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Technical notes
%  This script generates phase-locked spike sequences using the 
%  Poissonian spike generation algorithm and the von Mises distribution. 
%  For detailed relations between the von Mises distribution and resulting 
%  vector strength, see Ashida et al. (2013) Front Comput Neurosci 7:151
